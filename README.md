### About me ðŸ‘‹

My name's [Nimrod Aizenberg](https://github.com/aizenimr/).
I used to be proffessional software designer in the past. Today I'm a CIT in an industrial company, which means that programming is a part time hobby, combined with part time actual programming in my day job.

## What do I do on Github?
My main activity in Github is my [blog](https://aizenimr.com/), which is implemented as a static site generator project written via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## What do I write about?
I have been writing and publishing short speculative fiction since 2015, most of it included in my blog.
My blog posts also revolve around geek humour, contemporary satire and (sometimes) tech and software developement.
